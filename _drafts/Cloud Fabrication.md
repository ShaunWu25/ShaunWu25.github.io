Introduction
Lin Hwai-min is an internationally celebrated dancer, choreographer, and founder of Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan. The theatre’s productions have been one of its kind because it mixes Western and Eastern dance technique and performs unique abstract contemporary dancing style. The theater was moved from Bali to Tamsui in 2008 after a fire accident with serious damages caused. The new location is at a countryside surrounded by plenty of mountains, therefore, the shape of the theater roof was formed like a cloud floating in a natural environment to achieve a harmonious feeling in a natural context. In this project, I am responsible for curved surface optimization, rationalization and split four curved surfaces into modular size.

Modular Metal Panel
To form a smooth roof shape, the entire curved roof is consists of four main surfaces, and each curved surface has a different shape and curvature. Also, the four curved surfaces were divided into similar sizes of planar metal panel so the production of modular metal panel could become easier.

Parametric tools such as Grasshopper, Galapagos and Kangaroo are used to develop and rebuild four surfaces’s curvatures into rational range for construction Although some inaccurate gaps still exist on certain area, by controlling parameter of Grasshopper, acceptable range could be reached when constructors using bended metal panel on the surface
