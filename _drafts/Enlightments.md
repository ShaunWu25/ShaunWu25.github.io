What is Church?
Church is a place where people can communicate with God and people. It’s a place we can see, smell and feel. It’s a place where we find inner peace.

We talk, we walk, we feel the nature. We integrate into the church. Then we found the peace.The church is just like a “Park”. My core concept in this project is to create a natural form to let people thinking they are walking in a natural environment.

On the plan strategy, multiple entrances are designed to allow people entering the Church from different directions. “Voronoi” is used to develop an organic shape of building, and reduce the hard corners to soften edges on the building.

Human invents straight line, but God doesn’t.

Stained Glass
Stained glass, an ancient form of illuminated wall decoration, has been commonly applied to the windows in churches with the purpose to spread religious narratives that inspire the faithful.

In this project, I try to think another way of stained glass, while keeping traditional meaning, parametric tools are added as a modern element to demonstrate the light of god.

Light and Shadow Effect
During the late Medieval period, most of glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of silica, the essential material for glass manufacture.

Silica requires very high heat in order to become molten, something not all glass factories were able to achieve.

Because of its unique material properties, it’s easy to imagine how expensive stained glass it was. The second reason for its high cost is because it required different shapes of stained glass to achieve marvellous light and shadow effect.

In this project, I applied a simple technique to reproduce the complex light and shadow effect with a minimized budget.

Here, every single stained glass is rotated to the horizontal level, and then set in module size. When the sunlight passes through the stained glass, it created incredible reflection and projection effects on roof, floor and interior space.


Computation
There are about six thousand pieces of stained glass on the facade, each stained glass has been set in modular size through the parametric tool.

People can’t see the image if they stand too far from the church, because all the stained glasses are being placed horizontally. But if they are close enough to the church, and look up the facade, then they would observe the spectacular picture built by thousand of stained glasses right in front of them, and that surprising feeling is exactly what I want to create to people when they come to visit church.
