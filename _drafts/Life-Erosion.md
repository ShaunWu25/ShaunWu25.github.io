PRESERVED / NATURAL
If wood is put under preservation treatment, as a material it loses the connection with time. The project block is composed of natural driftwood and preserved timber material. In years, the natural part gradually rots away in the intertidal zone, while the preserved wood exposes as a bare bone skeleton, forming a more permanent existence.

LIVING / NATURE
A house is usually considered permanent: however, our lives actually change with time. This project provides a dwelling condition that gradually transforms with the passing of time. The disintegration of the housing material correlates with the life of the inhabitant. After the dweller leaves the place, the house is returned to its natural environment.
