Particle system

I recently started to explore particle system. It is surprising that it only requires high school knowledge in physics to build up such tool.
Particle system can be used as a form-finding tool for designing a hanging chain model or cable nets structure that Frei Otto and Antoni Gaudi similar did in their physical experimentation.
This post will docuement what I have been developed step by step. By the end of this post, you will be seeing a simple physic engine built within [Rhino][RH]/[Grasshopper][GH] environment in C# programming language.

In fact, there are already existing physic engines available for Grasshopper users, such as [Kangaroo][KH], [Flexhopper][FH], or [PhysX.GH][PH].
The idea is not taking available tools for granted, it is important to understand its logic and use it consciously.
The aim of this post is trying to reveal the underlying principle of physic engines by explaining it in particle system.
Subsequently, I hope the reader(you!) can build your own physic engine, and develop it from scratch.

## C# Component Setup

The main scripting will take place in a C# scripting component. We will first set up our component and understand how the data is stored and processed. The initial input is a boolean button to reset the computational process and a timer attached at the bottom of the component to update the process in certain time interval. You can right click the timer to select your desired interval. The outputs will be the current position and velocity of the particle. Remember to keep the timer disabled if you are not using it, otherwise the C# script component will be running indefinitely in the background and consume your computer's memory heavily.

We can open up the C# scripting editor by double-clicking the C# scripting component. The run script area is where the script will be executed. We set a condition to reset the process if we click the reset button and the output ports will extract the current particle information from the global scope area. The global scope is where we store particle's attributes as persistent data and the states of the particle is stored in every execution so we will be able to view the intermediate changes in run time.

## Particle

Particle can be described as a localised object. Each particle has its own set of attributes, such as position, velocity, mass, and other information that might be useful to attach with it. These attributes, however, are all dimensionless, we can of course logically assign certain units on it, but what we actually care is its kinematic movement. In other words, how particles move in a given environment.

## Falling ball simulation

Particle is moved toward to a direction by a given or a set of force act on it. We will start from simulating a single particle or a falling ball and observe how the particle respond to its own weight. Gravity in this case, will be the only force that act on the ball. To calculate the force act on the ball by gravity, we will borrow Newton's laws of motion *(F = m a)*.   
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/2011_ParticleSystem/201110_02.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" height="200" />

```c#
private void RunScript(bool button, double mass, double gravity, ref object Position, ref object Velocity)
  {

    if(button)
    {
      pt = Point3d.Origin;
      velocity = Vector3d.Zero;
    }
    else
    {
      Tuple<Point3d, Vector3d> compute = fall(pt, mass, gravity, velocity);
      pt += compute.Item1;
      velocity += compute.Item2;
    }
    Position = pt;
    Velocity = velocity;
  }

  // <Custom additional code> 
  Point3d pt = new Point3d(0, 0, 0);
  Vector3d velocity = new Vector3d(0, 0, 0);

  Tuple<Point3d, Vector3d> fall (Point3d pt, double mass, double gravity, Vector3d velocity)
  {
    double forceZ = mass * gravity;  // newton's law
    Vector3d accelerationZ = new Vector3d(0, 0, -forceZ / mass); // calculate the acceleration of the particle, forceZ is inverted

    Vector3d velocity_current = (velocity + accelerationZ); // update velocity
    Point3d pt_position = pt + velocity; // update position 

    return Tuple.Create(pt_position, velocity_current);
  }
  // <Custom additional code>
```

That's it! We have made our very first physic engine! To make the ball falling downward in our coodinate system, the force Z is therefore inverted at the line where we calculate the acceleration.
Now let's make one step further by adding a bit complexity for a spring simulation.  

## Single Spring Simulation

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/2011_ParticleSystem/201112_bouncing balll.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" height="500" />

Single spring simulation will have two additional forces compared to our previous falling ball simulation:
1. Spring Force (Force = Spring Constant * Î” L(Length - Rest Length)): <br />
It is widely known as [Hooke's Law][HL] that a force is exerted if a spring is compressed or extended in relation with its rest length. Rest length means the length of spring in a state of equilibrium. The value of Spring Constant depends on the type of spring we applied which can be a reasonable arbitary none zero value for our simulation.

2. Damping Force (Force = Damping Constant * Particle's Velocity): <br />
Damping force is always remained opposite to the direction of the spring force. It is the force to slow dowm the particle's motion by associating with particle's velocity. Similar to Spring Constant, Damping constant is a arbitary value.

In addition, we will add one more particle(particle 1) at the origin as our anchoring point which remains constantly static without being affected by any forces. Particle 2 will be the falling ball particle with a spring connected to particle 1. Below is a diagram that illustrates how three forces interact with each other.

```c#
private void RunScript(bool button, double mass, double gravity, double spring, double damping, Point3d anchorPt, Point3d StartingPt, ref object Position, ref object Velocity)
  {
    if(button)
    {
      pt = StartingPt;
      velocity = Vector3d.Zero;
    }
    else
    {
      Tuple<Point3d, Vector3d> compute = physic_engine(pt, mass, gravity, velocity, damping, anchorPt, spring);
      pt = compute.Item1;
      velocity = compute.Item2;
    }
    Position = pt;
    Velocity = velocity;
  }

  // <Custom additional code> 
  Point3d pt = new Point3d(0, 0, 0);
  Vector3d velocity = new Vector3d(0, 0, 0);

  Tuple<Point3d, Vector3d> physic_engine (Point3d pt, double mass, double gravity, Vector3d velocity, double damping, Point3d anchorPt, double spring)
  {
    double forceSpring_Z = -spring * (pt.Z - anchorPt.Z);
    double forceSpring_Y = -spring * (pt.Y - anchorPt.Y);
    double forceSpring_X = -spring * (pt.X - anchorPt.X);

    double forceDamping_Z = damping * velocity.Z;
    double forceDamping_Y = damping * velocity.Y;
    double forceDamping_X = damping * velocity.X;

    double forceGravity = mass * -gravity;

    double forceZ = forceSpring_Z - forceDamping_Z + forceGravity ;
    double forceY = forceSpring_Y - forceDamping_Y;
    double forceX = forceSpring_X - forceDamping_X;

    Vector3d acceleration = new Vector3d(forceX / mass, forceY / mass, forceZ / mass);

    Vector3d velocity_current = (velocity + acceleration);
    Point3d pt_current = pt + velocity_current;

    return Tuple.Create(pt_current, velocity_current);
  }
  // </Custom additional code>
