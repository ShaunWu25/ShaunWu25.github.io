The theme of the workshop is “Resonance”. It is the reflections triggered by physical phenomena or works of art. It exists as an amplified accompaniment to a force, vibration, or perception – both physically and emotionally. We often found that the effects of resonance penetrate between different states and media.

Design Goals
Learn and hack the sciences of natural forces and phenomena
Use the tools to make things and rediscover their potentials
imagine and figure out the mechanism of the resonance
Radically make something to realize it
animate

Design Brief
The project of perception is aiming to response and mimic the pure beauty of nature by visible sun light and invisible gravity on two surfaces. Through the advanced digital technique, we experiment various ways to create marvelous light and shadow effect, and redefine the essence of space by gravity simulation.
