Using ocean variability to create a transformable cultivation installation

In recent years, the number of Taiwan`s abalone aquaculture has risen in order to meet the increasing market demand.

Traditionally, the cultivation method involves first to blow up the bedrock along the coast in order to build the cultivation platform above it. It not only damaged the marine environment and also failed to respond the different faces of a natural environment. I`m thinking how to combine dynamic cultivation system with

ocean ecosystem to interact with ocean currents, seasons, as well as the different heights of tide to provide a transformable installation which responses the diversity of natural environment.

Give a life cycle to a man-made installation. Design a theme with nature, trying to find a “dynamic balance” between architecture and nature.

Site
In the northeast coast of Taiwan, abrasion platforms(海蝕平臺) are formed for thousand years, and it also plays a significant role to keep food chain stable.

Unfortunately, fisherman blew up abrasion platform to build cultivation facilities above ocean, taking advantage of variation of ocean(current, tide for refreshing water periodically、temperature) to achieve cultivated requirements.

It becomes a specific landscape system for breeding small abalone. These landscapes follow the rules of ocean variations, using different heights of tide and change of seasons to raise small abalone.

If we can rethink coastline with the same concept of cultivated landscape system, then dynamic coastline is a way to deal with the relationship between land and ocean.

Placement Strategy
The ideal depth for cultivation installations is within 25 meters. In this area, the suitable environment including the density of salt, nutritious seaweeds, ocean temperature ) for small abalone. In other words, it’s the best location for small abalone to grow up.

Several relatively closed boundaries would be shown during the process of rotation. The darkest area has longest period of closed boundary, which means it will be smoother than other places in terms of wave intensity, so it’s an appropriate area to breed younger small abalone, and it also could be used as a waterfront park for tourist.

The closest boundaries have a stable marine environment to breed small abalone, it also can imply people that these areas have a safe condition to interact with water.

In general, the boundary between ocean and land was just a simple linear wall, levee or fence. In this project, it was aiming at providing “thickness” on this line, using thickness as a buffer zone to deal with the relationship between ocean and land.

Base on protecting water, preserving water, as well as refreshing water procedure, I combined inland aquaculture with aquatic aquaculture system. Traditional cultivation structure was designed to reduce the intensity of wave. Protect and stabilize the inside environment condition is the first priority for breeding small abalone.

In order to gain higher breeding number on same surface area, I choose to layer breeding buckets, which can increase the density for breeding small abalone. Moreover, by controlling the height of breeding buckets, fish can be allowed to go through the installation.

Transforming Process
Multi-functional space could be another choice to make space much more useful. The transformable pavilion is capable of adapting any program and can be changed when programs are no longer needed.

When the two coupling units start getting closer, the pavilion will rise, and it could be expected that the space under the pavilion could be used as a cultivation spaces for fishers and tourists. When underwater cultivation space changes, the pavilion could respond immediately through a transformable structure.
