A robotic fabrication workshop was held in Architecure Department, Tamkang University, Taiwan. It was hosted by a group of researchers and students from CCC Research Lab.

This workshop was meant to share and pass the knowledge from senior members to juniors, specifically focusing on digital design and digital fabrication.
The workshop was divided into two stages. First, we introduced basic information for operating 6-axis robotic arm, including the typical robot movements(move L, move J), offline-programming, grasshopper tutorials and basic data structure implementation.

In the second stage, participants were asked to develope their own logics to design a structural element, e.g. column, slab, wall. Fabricatiton was using pick and place method with small wooden blocks as fabrication material. UR5 robot was used and a vacuum system connected with compressor was developed with digital input/output integrated as picking force.

Our ripple columns were designed with pattern flowing on the surface. Each wooden block was placed at a slightly different angle to generate subtle transition as ripple. The challenge was to avoid collasping in the pick and place process.
