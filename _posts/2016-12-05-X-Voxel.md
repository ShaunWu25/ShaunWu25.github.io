## Spatially 3D Printed Structures
Robotic 3D printing could promote an alternative tectonic that encourages variation and differentiation on a large-scale, instead of being bound to geometric simpliﬁcation, standardisation and repetition.
The conceptual change, from layer-based material deposition to spatial extrusion, has several noteworthy implications: 
1. the fabrication time is signiﬁcantly reduced and becomes feasible for application in construction at the large scale.
2. the densities could be generated according to the various forces that act on the structure.

## Focus
* Functionally graded material (structural optimization, material efficiency, visual gradient);
* Material behavior variations via tool-path manipulation (stiffness / flexibility);
* Specific spatial 3D printing challenges (overhang, long spans, customized node connections);
* Ornamentation
