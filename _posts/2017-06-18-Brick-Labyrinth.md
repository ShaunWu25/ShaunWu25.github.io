The **Brick Labyrinth** is re-visiting one of the most archaic building techniques, dry-stacked brick walls, in a completely new setting. 

This project was a collective work within my master study in the ETH-Zurich Master of Advanced Studied(MAS) Program in Architecture and Digital Fabrication, academic year in 2016-2017. 
There were 17 students divided into 4 groups of Design, Fabrication, Structure and Tooling. I was in the strucutre group, mainly resbonsible for developing an algorithm for stability check.

For the first time, We used a multi-robotic gantry system in the [Robotic Fabrication Laboratory][Robotic-Fabrication-Laboratory] to build a full-scale architectural installation of a brick labyrinth. We used computational tools not only to iterate through designs but also to check the stability and feasibility of the produced structures and to generate the sequence and commands to control the multi-robotic fabrication of the final structure. Together with multiple iterations of physical tests and prototypes, this allowed us to design and build the labyrinth which consisted of over 10000 bricks with a weight of 30 tons in under 4 weeks.

“Dry Stacking” plays the main challenge role throughout the whole project. With no collapsing as criteria inside the RFL, Stability check as a crucial factor to determine the entire structure. Our structure group developed stability check script showing in each brick whether the resultant force was inside the contact areas of brick to evaluate feasible layout for the design team.

## Bond Transition

The bond transition and configuration between bricks changes at the places where light penetrating are needed and as counter-balance elements to increase the inclined ratio for shifting the center of mass on entire structure.

a parametric model was developed for studying smooth bond transition in design phase.
