## Whar is Witteveen+Bos Robot?

**Witteveen+Bos Robot** is a Rhinoceros3D/Grasshopper plugin for programming multi-axis gantry robots with a focus on 3D concrete printing. Witteveen+Bos Robot provides a seamless workflow from design to fabrication with full flexibilities and adaptabilities in an user-friendly matter. It consists out of custom built-in componenes that facilitates the planning and execution of robotic fabrication process embedded in the parametric design environment.

Witteveen+Bos Robot is completely written in [C#][c] programming language in [.NET][net] framework that includes multiple printing strategies which are fully standardized for concrete printing operations. The users, are able to convert digital 3D designs into relevant robotic codes in just a few mouse clicks.

The generated robot codes can be loaded directly on the robot controllers, such as [G-Code][GC] for [Siemens Sinumerik][SS], [Rapid][RA] for [ABB][ABB] robotic arm, [KUKA robot language][KR] for [KUKA][KK] robotic arm.
