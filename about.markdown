Hi there, this is Shaun.

<img src="/assets/about/01.jpg" alt="good boy!" style="width:300px;height:300px;">

This is my personal website, most of the contents here are related to computatonal design and digital fabrication, especially focusing on applying automation by means of robots and algorithms in Architecture, Engineering and Construction industries. 

If you want to know more about me with a bit of patience, then here you go:

# About 

吳岱軒 or Shaun, Dai-Syuan Wu, architect, and computational design specialist, studied in Architecture at Tamkang University in Taiwan and worked in architectural firms. In 2016, He continued his studies at the ETH-Zürich in Switzerland, and was conferred Master of Advanced Studies in [Architecture and Digital Fabrication][MASDFab] program, supervised by the chair of [Gramazio Kohler Research][GKR], and collaborated with the chair of [Digital Building Technology][DBT] by Professor [Benjamin Dillenburger][BD].

He masters complex geometry, specialising in the optimisation and rationalisation on non-standard geometry. He focuses on computational design and digital fabrication, implementing algorithmic programming procedures on Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry, which enables a systematic workflow from parametric design to BIM technology.

In 2013, he worked as a researcher at the [Digital Design & Fabrication LAB (CCC Lab)][CCCLAB], Dept. of Architecture, Tamkang University under the supervision of Professor [Chen Chen-Cheng][CCC].

Currently, he works at [Witteveen+Bos][WB] as a Computational Design Specialist within [Digital Construction Group][DCG] based in Singapore. He is responsible to develop advanced computational methonds for robotics, structural analysis, and form-finding designs. He is involved in various innovative research programs and commercial projects related to large-scale 3D concrete printing and robotic applications.

Interests/Specialities: Digital Fabrication, Programming, Structural Design, Architectural Design Research, Additive Manufacturing, 3D Concrete Printing, Robotic Application (ABB, KUKA, UR), Computational Design, Material Research, Complex Geometry Optimisation & Rationalisation.
